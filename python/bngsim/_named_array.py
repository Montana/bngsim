class NamedArray(np.ndarray):
    """A 2-D ndarray with named columns (RoadRunner-compatible).

    Constructed via :meth:`bngsim.Result.as_roadrunner`. End users
    rarely instantiate it directly; subclass primarily exists so that
    callers can identify the array shape (``arr.colnames``) and look
    up columns by name (``arr["[X]"]``, ``arr[:, "[X]"]``).

    Attributes
    ----------
    colnames : list[str]
        One name per column, in column order — the invariant
        :meth:`__new__` checks, and one that holds for the lifetime of
        every array of this class (issue #561). Names are *positional*,
        so they are carried exactly where this class can see the whole
        operation and knows what became of the columns: construction;
        indexing, which relabels whatever survives the key
        (``arr[:, 1:]``, ``arr[:, ["time", "[X]"]]``, ``arr[:, ::-1]``,
        a row slice); and a pickle round trip, so an array that crosses
        a process boundary arrives labeled (issue #629).

        Any other array numpy hands back — a product, a transpose, a
        reduction, ``arr.copy()``, :func:`copy.deepcopy`,
        ``np.copy(arr, subok=True)``, ``astype``, ``view`` — has
        ``colnames == []`` and raises :class:`KeyError` on a lookup by
        name, rather than answering with whichever column now sits at
        the name's old position. A copy is in that list although its
        columns are plainly the parent's: ``.copy()`` is one of numpy's
        own primitives (``np.sort(a, axis=1)`` is a copy followed by an
        in-place sort), so a copy that carried labels would hand them to
        operations that permute the columns underneath them. The comment
        on the method that is *not* overridden has the measurement.

        libroadrunner keeps the labels through pickle as this class
        does, and drops them on every derived array, copies and slices
        included. Where this class keeps more of them, it is additive —
        code written against RoadRunner cannot depend on a label being
        absent — and it keeps one only where the column is established
        to be the same column.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> result = sim.run(t_span=(0, 10), n_points=11)
    >>> arr = result.as_roadrunner()
    >>> arr.colnames
    ['time', '[X]', '[Y]']
    >>> arr["[X]"]                      # 1-D column view
    array([ ... ])
    >>> arr[:, "[X]"]                   # equivalent
    array([ ... ])
    >>> arr[:, 1:].colnames             # the columns the slice kept
    ['[X]', '[Y]']
