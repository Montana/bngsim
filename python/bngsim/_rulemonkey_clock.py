"""Run a clock-reading model on RuleMonkey on elapsed time (issue #1063).

Since #1022, ``method="rm"`` runs a model that reads the clock (``time()``, a
bare ``time``, or a table function indexed by time) on absolute model time, as
``ode`` and ``ssa`` do. RuleMonkey 3.11.0 placed each event at ``t + tau`` in
doubles, so from a large ``t_start`` the waiting times rounded away once the
total propensity times |t| neared 1e15, and the run was biased with no error: from
``t_start = 1e12``, ``A(s~0) -> A(s~1)`` at 0.5 from 1e5 copies left 22743 at
``1e12 + 2`` against the binomial mean 36788 (z = -291). A model that reads no
clock runs on elapsed time and is exact (#1060).

So a model that reads the clock through ``time()`` runs on elapsed time too,
and gets absolute time back through the model. :func:`offset_clock_xml` writes
a copy of the BNG XML in which every function reads the clock as
``(time()+__bngsim_t0)``, and the caller sets ``__bngsim_t0`` to the run's
``t_start`` before it runs. RuleMonkey resolves a parameter from the model's
parameter table wherever an expression names it (``<ListOfReferences>`` lists
only observables for it). Output functions are evaluated through the same
rewritten expressions, so they report on absolute time as before.

The clock is rewritten wherever RuleMonkey reads it and nowhere else
(:func:`~bngsim._network_free_checks.rulemonkey_clock_ref`): ``time()``, a bare
``time``, and its alias ``t``, except that a bare ``time`` or ``t`` that names a
model symbol reads the symbol. BNG2.pl accepts an observable named ``time``, and
turning that into the clock changed the rates of a model that reads no clock.

A table function indexed by the clock is not rewritten, and a model with one
runs on model time (the caller checks
:func:`~bngsim._network_free_checks.time_indexed_table_functions`). It needs no
offset: since 3.12.0 RuleMonkey places its events, and its panels for a rate
that reads the clock, on the time elapsed since each call starts
(richardposner/RuleMonkey#110), so such a run keeps its waiting times from a
large ``t_start`` (issue #1063). Offsetting it would have indexed the table
through a function, which 3.11.0 could not evaluate
(richardposner/RuleMonkey#111).
