"""Issue #643 — what ``copy.copy`` means for an extension-backed object.

``copy.copy(model)`` used to hand back a ``Model`` sharing the original's engine
handle. That is textbook shallow-copy behaviour — ``copy.copy`` is documented to
insert references to the objects found in the original — but all of a ``Model``'s
state lives behind that one handle, so there was nothing left for the copy to
own. The result was not a shallow copy in any useful sense; it was an alias with
a different ``id()``::

    c = copy.copy(m)          # m has k = 0.1
    c.set_param("k", 5.0)
    m.get_param("k")          # 5.0 — the write landed on m
    sim.run(...)              # and m now integrates to a different answer

Nothing raised, and the two things a caller reaches for next did not rescue
them: ``copy.deepcopy`` raises (it cannot pickle the handle), and ``clone()``,
which does give an independent model, is invisible from the copy path.

The call taken here: ``Model`` and ``Simulator`` refuse and name the remedy —
loud where the alias was silent, and it cannot make anyone's numbers quietly
wrong. ``Result`` keeps its copy: it has no setter and no mutating method, so
no call on the copy writes into the original. This file pins that split, and
pins the premise the Result half rests on, so that adding a setter to ``Result``
fails here rather than silently re-opening the trap.
