"""Issue #453 — mratio must refuse arguments it cannot compute correctly.

``mratio(a, b, z)`` is ``M(a+1,b+1,z) / M(a,b,z)``, evaluated by Gauss's
continued fraction with the modified Lentz method. Outside a certain region the
fraction converges to something that is not the ratio: errors reached a factor
of a thousand and in places the sign was wrong, with no warning and no failure.

Three findings shaped the fix, and each is the reason a cheaper fix does not
work.

* The approach to the false limit is indistinguishable from the approach to the
  true one. ``|Delta - 1|`` decays smoothly and geometrically into both. So no
  stopping test can separate them, however many consecutive hits it demands.
* Iterating longer does not help either. At 120 digits the same recurrence does
  reach the true value, but only after about 1600 steps where double precision
  settles at about 84; by then rounding has frozen the iterates.
* So the decision has to be made from the arguments, before the fraction runs.

The region it is trusted in, measured against a 40 digit reference, is all for
``b > 0`` only (issue #768): every grid behind it had a positive ``b``, and with
``b`` negative the fraction is wrong inside each clause. Within that:

* ``a`` a negative integer. Safe by construction rather than by
  measurement: the odd partial numerator carries ``z*(a+k)`` and reaches exactly
  zero at ``k = -a``, so the fraction terminates and computes a finite exact sum.
  Not ``a = 0`` (issue #768): the odd numerators start at ``k = 1``, so none of
  them vanishes there.
* ``a <= 0`` with ``z <= 0``. This is where BNG models live, since a model builds
  ``a = -min(AT, BT)`` and ``z = -1/Keq``, and it stays true when a fit moves the
  counts off the integers. Except past ``z = -20`` with ``b - a < 1`` (issue
  #1080), where the fraction loses about ``10*eps*sqrt(-z)/(b - a)`` of the
  ratio, which is everything once ``b`` and ``a`` are both tiny. Those are summed
  as two series out to ``z = -700`` and left to the asymptotic expansion past
  that. That is the very last section below.
* ``|z| <= 20``, clean over 3400 hostile triples where the first wrong answer
  anywhere is at ``|z| = 60``. Clean of false limits, that is: issue #1080
  found it losing digits there, up to 4.4e-7, when ``a`` is tiny next to ``b``
  or ``b`` itself is tiny, and those arguments are now summed as two series
  before this rule is asked. That is the last section below.
* ``b*b >= 64*|z*a|``, which says the odd partial numerators start small,
  and for a positive ``z`` also ``2*z <= b``, which is the same statement
  about the even ones. That second half is issue #456: without it this
  clause admitted a corner where the fraction was wrong 60 times, since
  the even numerators carry ``z*(a-b-k)`` and so are about ``z/b`` for a
  large ``b`` however small ``z*a`` is.

Everything else is refused by the fraction. That gives up answers it would have
got right, because in the uncertain region it is right most of the time and
there is no way to tell which. A refusal that says so is worth more than a
number that is usually right.

Issue #456 later narrowed what that gives up, by sending those arguments to an
asymptotic expansion that can vouch for its own accuracy before refusing them.
That is in test_mratio_asymptotic.py. It changed no answer the fraction was
already giving, which is what test_the_regime_models_use_still_answers below
holds it to.
