"""Issue #1158 — an event that re-arms its own trigger as it fires is refused.

``at (B > 0): B = 0, F = F + 1`` with ``B' = 1``: each fire puts B back on its
threshold, the flow makes the trigger true again at once, and the event fires
infinitely often at one instant (Zeno behaviour). No trajectory continues past
that instant, in bngsim or anywhere else; libRoadRunner stops at F = 2, which is
where its own event handling gives up, not an answer.

bngsim fired at every root CVODE reported, each one root tolerance (100 ulps of
|t| + |h|) after the last, about 4e5 fires a second, and ``run`` never returned:
over t in [0, 1e-12] as over [0, 2]. The chatter guard (GH #95) did not see it,
since each fire changes the state (F, or B and A) by more than the tolerance.

Those fires are the same instant to the solver, so a run of them is the
same-instant algebraic loop ``CASCADE_LIMIT`` (100000) already refuses, one
rounding at a time: a root batch within the root tolerance of the batch before
(whichever events fired in it, so a ring of events re-arming each other counts
too) is counted, and past the limit the run is refused, naming every event that
fired in the streak. A pulse train spaced by more than the root tolerance, which
CVODE resolves, never counts.
