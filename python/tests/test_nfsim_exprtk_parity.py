"""Behavioural tests for NFsim's ExprTk ``mu::Parser`` shim (issue #49).

The embedded NFsim path has two ExprTk-based expression layers: the host
``bngsim::ExprTkEvaluator`` (``bngsim/src/expression.cpp``) and NFsim's internal
``mu::Parser`` shim (``third_party/nfsim/src/NFfunction/nfsim_funcparser.h``).
The shim needs these BNG-compatibility features:

  * the ``mratio(a, b, z)`` built-in -- the confluent-hypergeometric ratio
    ``M(a+1, b+1, z) / M(a, b, z)``; and
  * a reserved-symbol remap, so a model symbol named like an ExprTk built-in
    (e.g. ``frac``) resolves to the model quantity instead of the built-in.
  * the ``rint(x)`` built-in, BNG's ``floor(x + 0.5)`` (issue #771).

Per issue #49 the shim no longer carries a hand-ported copy of this logic: it
**forwards** each feature to the host single source ``bngsim::expr_compat``
(``mratio``, ``rint`` and ``compute_registration_name`` / ``remap_name``), linked into the
vendored NFsim target via ``bngsim::expression``. There is therefore no second
implementation to drift -- so the old host-vs-shim parity assertion has been
retired as tautological.

What these tests still pin, and why it remains meaningful: the function columns
read below are evaluated *inside NFsim* via ``FuncFactory::Eval`` (see
``bngsim/src/nfsim_simulator.cpp`` ``eval_output_function``) -- i.e. through the
shim's ``mu::Parser`` adapters, which forward to the host. Anchoring those
columns to an *independent* oracle (``scipy.special.hyp1f1`` for ``mratio``,
arithmetic for the reserved remap) confirms end-to-end that the adapter forwards
correctly *and* that the vendored NFsim object actually links the host's single
source at runtime -- not merely that the code compiles.

The ``m_*`` functions take only constant arguments, so their value depends solely
on the ``mratio`` implementation, not on the (stochastic) trajectory; the
``frac`` observable counts molecules of ``F``, which no rule touches, so it is a
fixed ``7`` for all time. See ``tests/data/nfsim/exprtk_shim_parity.xml``.
