"""A sensitivity run is carried over a bend it stalls at, not refused (issue #1229).

The issue #952 hold check ends a run with sensitivities whose state is held
within a few ulp of a state-switch surface, because at a jump there is a
saltation term to apply and no crossing time to take it from. It asked that
of every surface, and a bend has neither: where a triangle pulse returns to 0
the rate law is continuous, and only its slope changes, by ~1/w². At a tight
tolerance that slope change fails the error test on the step to it, and the
run was refused for a jump that does not exist. The same pulse written with
``if()`` was refused the same way.

A stalled surface is now read a step either side along the flow (the #150
probe), and one the right-hand side is continuous across, or that no rate law
reads (a bend stop), is carried over as a plain run's is, the columns
unchanged. A stalled surface it jumps across is refused as before; see
``test_pinned_state_switch_sensitivity.py``. So is a carry that would take
something else across with it, a jump spelled apart from the pulse or an
event's trigger on the same surface: neither has a crossing time there.

The model is ``test_bend_sensitivity_rhs.py``'s: a counter T at k_clock = 2, and
X -> Y at a triangle of area 0.5 in T, of width w, centred on 50. Exact
dY/dk_clock = -0.973501 and Y = 10(1 - e^(-1/4)).
