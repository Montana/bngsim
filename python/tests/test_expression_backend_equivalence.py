"""GH #579 — the three expression backends must agree, or decline out loud.

Six places in the tree parse or translate model expressions, each with its own
grammar, and nothing asserted that they agree. Six issues came out of that gap
one at a time, each found by a user at runtime on a model that had worked the
day before: ``^`` handled three different ways (#554, #555, #573), an n-ary
``max`` that would not compile (#556), ``jnp.jnp.log`` (#564), a missing
``log10`` mapping (#565).

This is the differential test #579 asks for. Three of those grammars translate
the same rate-law text — the ExprTk evaluator the ODE and SSA engines run, the
C the codegen backend emits, and the JAX the ``jacobian="jax"`` path emits —
so each expression below is driven through all three at the same state and the
same time, and their answers are compared.

The comparison is made where the engines make it: at a derivative. Each
expression becomes the functional rate law of a synthetic ``0 -> PROBE``
reaction, so ``dPROBE/dt`` *is* the expression, evaluated by the same
``compute_derivs`` CVODE calls. The compiled-C and JAX legs translate that same
rate law and evaluate it against the same numbers.

Two things are asserted, and the second matters as much as the first:

* where all three backends accept a form, their values agree;
* where one cannot, it says so while the expression is still in hand, naming
  what it could not translate — rather than emitting C that will not compile or
  Python that will raise somewhere inside a solve.

Each leg is gated on its own: the C leg needs a compiler, the JAX leg needs
JAX, and either runs without the other.
