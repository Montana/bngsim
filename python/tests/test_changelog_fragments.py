"""``changelog.d/`` fragments assemble into ``CHANGELOG.md`` without losing
anything, and the checks that enforce them are not no-ops (issue #668).

Every changelog entry used to be inserted at one anchor — the top of
``## [Unreleased]`` → ``### Fixed`` — so any two open branches edited the same
region of the same file and git stopped on a conflict. 17 of the 30 merges
before the issue touched the file, and hand-resolving the same region repeatedly
is where two shipped defects came from: #662 committed literal conflict markers,
#656 duplicated its entry verbatim. ``ci/changelog.py`` replaces the anchor with
one file per change.

Three properties are worth a test, and each one is a specific way this could be
worse than what it replaced:

* **Assembly loses nothing.** ``build`` is the only writer of ``CHANGELOG.md``
  now, and it runs once per release with no one reading its diff line by line.
  A dropped entry would reach a published GitHub Release.
* **The order is the assembler's, not the contributor's.** That is the half
  ``merge=union`` cannot do — it keeps both sides verbatim and will happily put
  the newest entry second.
* **The checks fail on the shape they describe.** #664 is the cautionary case:
  the ``check-merge-conflict`` hook meant to catch #662's markers returns success
  without opening a file unless git is mid-merge, so it was green in CI while
  the markers sat in the tree. A changelog gate that cannot fail is the honour
  system with a checkmark on it.
