"""bngsim solver work counters recorded beside each parity verdict (GH #702).

Wall-clock time on a shared CI runner is too noisy to catch a modest efficiency
regression, but the solver's work is not: for a fixed model, build and platform,
CVODE's step, RHS-evaluation and Jacobian-evaluation counts are deterministic. A
change that makes bngsim do more work for the same answer (a Jacobian falling
back to finite differences, a step-size control change, an event forcing
restarts) shows up here with no timing noise at all. The nightly check
(``parity_checks/nightly/verdicts.py``) compares these per model against a
baseline.
