"""The pre-push hook's pytest run: all of ``python/tests``, in parallel.

Run serially in one process, the suite took 44m29s on a 16-core Apple Silicon
Mac (2026-10-18, 16,834 tests, warm artifact cache), and every push paid it.
Under pytest-xdist with one test file per worker the same run took 4m42s on 12
workers, with the same outcome test for test. Nothing is dropped to get there:
this is still the whole directory, so the hook and python-tests.yml keep
running one suite.

``--dist worksteal``: tests go to the workers one at a time, and a worker that
runs out takes queued tests from the others. One file per worker (``loadfile``)
made the slowest file the floor: test_expression_backend_equivalence.py, about
five minutes on one worker. In a checkout without the gitignored corpora,
``loadfile`` took 304 s and ``worksteal`` 184 s on 12 workers, and every one of
the 13,573 tests had the same outcome both ways (2026-10-18). A module- or
class-scoped fixture is then built once per worker that runs one of its tests,
rather than once per file; 14 of the 475 files have one.

**The test cache is shared with the main checkout.** macOS checks a newly
written ``.dylib`` the first time anything loads it, at 0.5-2.4 s a file, and it
checks them one at a time across the whole machine: twelve fresh libraries
loaded at once by twelve processes took 11.1 s, finishing one after another.
Once a file has been checked, every later load of it, in any process, is
instant. A copy of it at another path is checked again. So a ``.claude`` or
``bngsim-wt`` worktree, whose own ``.pytest_cache`` starts empty, recompiles and
re-checks every codegen library the suite builds: the first push from one took
19m15s on 12 workers, most of it waiting on those checks. So from a worktree,
unless ``BNGSIM_TEST_CACHE_DIR`` is already set, this points it at the main
checkout's ``.pytest_cache/d/bngsim``. The main checkout itself is left on
pytest's own route to that same directory. The cache is content-addressed and
written by atomic rename, so two checkouts sharing it is safe.

The worker count defaults to the number of cores that are not efficiency cores
on Apple Silicon, and to xdist's ``auto`` (one per CPU) everywhere else. On the
same 12+4-core Mac, ``auto``'s 16 workers took 5m27s against 12 workers' 4m42s
(one file per worker, then): work dealt to an efficiency core runs slower.
``BNGSIM_PREPUSH_WORKERS`` overrides the count, and ``0`` runs the whole suite
in a single pytest process with no xdist at all, as the hook used to, for a
failure that might be about what ran before it.

Without pytest-xdist the hook stops at once and says how to get it. Running
serially instead would turn a five-minute push into a 45-minute one that
pre-commit reports only as ``Passed``, since it shows a passing hook's output
to no one.

**A push that changes only files the suite never reads does not run it.**
pre-commit passes the pushed range as ``PRE_COMMIT_FROM_REF`` and
``PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF``, and this lists the changed paths itself: ``git diff``
between the two tips' trees, with each rename split into its two paths.
pre-commit's own diff is three-dot, from the merge base, and would miss what a
force-push takes away: rewind past a test edit, add a fragment, and only the
fragment would show. A hook's ``files``/``exclude`` cannot make this decision
either. pre-commit drops paths that no longer exist before it matches them, so
a push that deletes a test file and adds a changelog fragment would show the
hook only the fragment, and the config's top-level ``exclude`` hides
``third_party/`` from every hook. When every changed path matches
``SKIPPABLE``, or the two trees are the same, the hook passes at once.
Anything else runs the suite: another path, a diff that fails, a pushed tip
that is not the commit checked out, or no range at all (``pre-commit run pytest
--hook-stage pre-push``, or this script run by hand).

This takes the commit the remote already has to have passed the suite. A
skipped push does not check that again: a branch that was already red, such as
a main merged before CI finished, is CI's to catch.

The suite tests the checkout, and pre-commit passes the range of only the first
ref a push names, which ``push.default=matching`` and ``--all`` list in
alphabetical order. A range whose tip is not ``HEAD`` therefore says nothing
about the tree the suite would test: a fragment-only branch named first must
not skip a suite the checked-out branch's own change needs.
