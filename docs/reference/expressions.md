# Expression language reference

BNGsim uses [ExprTk](https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk) as its expression
evaluation engine, replacing the older muParser used by BioNetGen's `run_network`.
ExprTk compiles expressions to bytecode for fast repeated evaluation during simulation.

## Built-in Constants

All constants use an underscore prefix to avoid collision with user parameter names.
They use SI units (matching BNG conventions).

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `_pi` | 3.14159265358979 | Pi (π) |
| `_e` | 2.71828182845905 | Euler's number |
| `_NA` | 6.02214076 × 10²³ | Avogadro's number (mol⁻¹) |
| `_kB` | 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ | Boltzmann constant (J/K) |
| `_R` | 8.314462618 | Gas constant (J/(mol·K)) |
| `_h` | 6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ | Planck constant (J·s) |
| `_F` | 96485.33212 | Faraday constant (C/mol) |

Example usage in a `.net` file function:
```
begin functions
    1 kT()  _kB * Temperature    # thermal energy
end functions
```

## Built-in Functions

BNGsim provides all standard ExprTk functions plus BNG-specific extensions:

**Trigonometric**: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`,
`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`

**Exponential/logarithmic**:
- `exp(x)` — e^x
- `log(x)` — **natural logarithm** (this matches BNG/C++ convention; NOT base-10)
- `ln(x)` — alias for `log(x)` (natural log)
- `log2(x)` — base-2 logarithm
- `log10(x)` — base-10 logarithm
- `sqrt(x)` — square root

**Rounding**: `floor`, `ceil`, `round`, `trunc`
- `rint(x)` — BNG's `rint()`: `floor(x + 0.5)`, so a half always rounds
  **up** (toward +∞), as BNG2.pl's `run_network` computes it. `rint(2.5)` is 3,
  `rint(-2.5)` is -2 and `rint(-0.5)` is 0. It is not the same as `round(x)`,
  which rounds a half away from zero: `round(-2.5)` is -3. The two agree at
  and above zero. Below zero they differ at every half, and also where
  `x - 0.5` itself rounds: `round(-0.49999999999999994)` is -1, `rint` of it 0.

**Other math**: `abs`, `min`, `max`, `clamp`, `avg`, `sum`, `erf`, `erfc`
- `sign(x)` — returns -1, 0, or 1 (alias: `sgn`)

**Control flow**:
- `if(condition, true_value, false_value)` — ternary conditional. Condition is
  true when it is **nonzero** (`condition != 0`), in every bngsim backend: the
  ODE interpreter, compiled (`codegen=True`) models, SSA, PSA, NFsim and
  RuleMonkey. Example: `if(A_tot > 100, k_fast, k_slow)`

  A relational or logical condition (`>`, `<=`, `==`, `&&`, `||`, ...) always
  evaluates to exactly 0 or 1, so this is the same answer BNG2.pl gives. The
  rule matters only for a *bare* number used as the condition: BNG2.pl's
  `run_network` tests `condition > 0.5`, so a condition in `(0, 0.5]` or a
  negative one takes the true branch in bngsim and the false branch in
  `run_network`. For example, `if(c, 10, 20)` with `c = 0.3` gives 10 here and
  20 there. To get the same result in both, write the comparison you mean,
  e.g. `if(c > 0.5, 10, 20)` or `if(c != 0, 10, 20)`.

**Time**:
- `time()` — current simulation time (updated by CVODE/SSA at each step)

`time()` is the only way to read the clock. `t` is **not** an alias for it: it
is left free as an ordinary identifier, so that a model may name a parameter or
observable `t` (the BNGL counter idiom `Molecules t counter()` is why), matching
BNG2.pl. A bare `t` in an expression is that model symbol, and `t()` is the same
symbol written as a zero-argument call — the form BNG2.pl emits and which bngsim
accepts for any scalar. In a model that defines no `t`, both spellings fail to
compile rather than falling back to the clock.

One place does treat `t` as the clock, and it is a different grammar: the
*index name* of a table function, where `time`, `T`, `Time()` and `t()` all
select simulation time. See [Table functions](../user-guide/table-functions.md).

**Special functions**:
- `mratio(a, b, z)` — confluent hypergeometric ratio M(a+1,b+1,z)/M(a,b,z)

## The `mratio` Function

`mratio(a, b, z)` computes the ratio of confluent hypergeometric (Kummer)
functions:

```
mratio(a, b, z) = M(a+1, b+1, z) / M(a, b, z)
```

where M(a, b, z) = ₁F₁(a; b; z) is Kummer's confluent hypergeometric function.
This ratio arises in stochastic gene expression models (e.g., the steady-state
distribution of mRNA in a two-state promoter model).

Ported from BNG's `Util::Mratio` (W. S. Hlavacek, 2018). Evaluated by Gauss's
continued fraction with the modified Lentz method, and by an asymptotic expansion
for arguments the fraction cannot be trusted with. Arguments neither method can
vouch for are refused rather than answered, because the fraction is silently
wrong there. See `expr_compat::mratio` in `src/expression.cpp` for the region and
the reasoning behind it.

`mratio` is differentiable in its third argument, so a rate law that reaches a
fitted rate constant through `z` (BNG writes `z = -1/Keq`) gets an analytic
forward-sensitivity gradient rather than CVODES' difference quotient. The first
two arguments have no closed-form derivative, so a model differentiating through
one of them falls back to the difference quotient.

Example in a `.net` file:
```
begin functions
    1 mean_mRNA()  mratio(k_on/gamma, (k_on + k_off)/gamma, rho/gamma)
end functions
```

## Logical Operators

BNG2.pl emits C-style logical operators (`&&`, `||`) in function expressions.
BNGsim automatically converts these to ExprTk's keyword syntax:
- `&&` → `and`
- `||` → `or`

Example (these are equivalent):
```
if(A_tot >= 0 && A_tot <= 200, k_active, 0)    # BNG2.pl output
if(A_tot >= 0 and A_tot <= 200, k_active, 0)    # ExprTk native
```

## Case Sensitivity

BNGsim treats all identifiers as **case-sensitive**. Parameters `k3` and `K3`
are distinct variables with independent values. This matches BNG conventions
and prevents silent name collisions during expression evaluation.

## Adding Functions from Python

There is no Python hook for registering a callable as an expression function.
The evaluator is a C++ object, and the right-hand side runs with the GIL
released, so a Python callback would have to reacquire it on every evaluation —
serializing the thread-parallel batch sweeps that releasing it buys. Two
supported routes cover what such a callback would be used for.

**Declare the function in the model.** A `begin functions` block in the `.net`
file (or the equivalent in the BNGL, SBML or Antimony source) is where a
closed-form function belongs; it is compiled with the rest of the rate laws and
differentiated symbolically for sensitivities:

```
begin functions
    1 hill()  A_tot^2 / (Kh^2 + A_tot^2)
end functions
```

**Add a table function from Python.** An external signal supplied as data and
interpolated at each step — a forcing term, a dosing schedule, or a measured
time course:

```python
model = bngsim.Model.from_net("model.net")
model.add_table_function("signal", file="signal.tfun")
model.add_table_function("drive", times=[0, 1, 2, 5, 10], values=[0, 0, 1, 5, 5])
```

See the [table function guide](../user-guide/table-functions.md) for the `.tfun`
format, non-time index variables, and the interpolation and extrapolation rules.

## Full ExprTk Documentation

For the complete ExprTk expression syntax (operator precedence, string operations,
vector operations, etc.), see the upstream documentation:
https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk

BNGsim uses a subset of ExprTk focused on numerical expressions. String and
vector operations are disabled for compilation performance.
